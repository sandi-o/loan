## Project Setup

Run the following:

- composer install
- create .env file (you may copy the .env.example and modify the connection string)
- php artisan key:generate
- php artisan migrate
- php artisan db:seed (this will create a user that will be used when generating a token later)
- php artisan passport:install
- php artisan config:cache
- php artisan serve (to run locally)

To run unit Tests:

- php artisan test

Note(s): when running the php artisan test it will refersh the database and will create some faker data to mock loans and loan transaction. setup a test environment if you don't want to override the data.

To test the api and it's documentation run:

- php artisan l5-swagger:generate

After running the above code, you should be able to test the api by http://localhost:8000/api/documentation

To authorize the user in Swagger:

- use the id with name "Password Grant Client" in oauth_clients together with it's secret to login

Notes(s): make sure your Token URL is http://127.0.0.1:8000/oauth/token to ensure the authorization process

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
